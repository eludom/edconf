This is a repository of ed(1) configuration files and hacks.
Other editors give you more, ed(1) gives you less.

Impress your friends, drop gems like this:

  export VISUAL=/bin/ed

into your =~/.bashrc= or =/etc/profile=

NOTE: This git repo (edconf) refers to "ED(1) CONFiguration", and in
no way should be confused with the twitter account @ed1conf of "The
premier conference for ed(1), the standard text editor.  Accessible at
300 baud".

I will accept pull requests, but it could well be argued that the
beauty of ed(1) is that it needs no configuration to do (what little)
it does (edit file) well.  Delete requests will be given full
consideration.  Less is more, more or less.

No EBCDIC characters where harmed in the making of this README.
